# HashMap

Hashmap (also known as a Hash Table) which is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides the following:
+ efficient lookups
+ insertions
+ deletions

It uses a hash function to map keys to specific indexes (or buckets) in an underlying array, making it possible to access the corresponding value in constant time, on average.
